            <h3>Time management</h3>
            <p>Time management is an integral part of any major project,
                including studying for a degree. Therefore, you need to manage
                your time effectively in order to sustain a balance between
                study, work and other life commitments.  Planning your time
                increases your chances of enjoying life as a student and helps
                to reduce stress about assignment deadlines and exams.
            </p>
            <p>Good time management requires that you take a pro-active
              approach – know yourself, your goals, strengths and weaknesses –
              know how you are currently using your time and how you need to
              reorganise it. Try using the weekly and semester planners
              provided below and once completed, display them in a prominent
              place at home where everyone who needs to can see them.
            </p>

            <p>Complete this inventory to work out where your time goes.
               Be as honest as possible to find out how many hours per week
               you have for study.

            <h3>Creating a study space</h3>
            <p>Creating a study environment that works for you will help you
               to focus on your learning and enjoy your studies. Checking the
               personal resources available to you at home, at university and
               other places, as well as within yourself, can reveal any
               aspects you need to focus on. These resources could include
               a space to work, equipment, support people and your own
               skills, attitudes and study habits. This section shares ideas
               on creating your work space, organising resources and doing
               your best to ensure you don’t lose your work by backing it up
               and using anti-virus software.

            <p>Managing your studies includes considering the resources
               available to support you. These can be at home, university
               and elsewhere. Consider too the personal resources and
               attributes that you bring to your studies.
